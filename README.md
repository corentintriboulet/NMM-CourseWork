# NMM-CourseWork
Numerical Methods in Mechanics at Centrale Lyon

## Objectives
This course is an introduction to the numerical methods used in simulation software, in solid mechanics, fluid mechanics (CFD)
and in energetics. The numerical methods allowing the resolution of boundary value problems in these disciplines are
presented. The objective is to master the concepts required for a proper use of industrial software. A particular effort is devoted
to the implementation and the physical interpretation, and interdisciplinarity allows for a better understanding of modellings and
physical phenomena.
